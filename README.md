EPI
Game Design Documentation
Version 1

IDEA
EPI is an overhead, top down real time strategy game (RTS) in which a country controlled by the player’s choosing seeks to eliminate a global pandemic.
SUMMARY
EPI is a 2D health related RTS developed for mobile platforms. The initial platform will be for IOS, with Android development to follow. Ultimately, a revamped version with many more features would be ideally developed for other platforms outside of mobile, but this is dependent on game performance.
The primary ambition for EPI is to develop a game opposite of games such as Plague Inc., and Pandemic 2. It is unique in that there is currently no game on the market like it, and I believe it will attract individuals’ who are looking for varied gameplay from infect the world games.
GAMEPLAY
EPIDEMIOLOGISTS determine the SYMPTOMS and TRAITS associated with an unknown disease. Their proficiency in doing so is dependent on their training, which can be improved with CAPITAL. EPIDEMIOLOGISTS inform SCIENTISTS of symptoms associated with unknown disease, and SCIENTISTS are able to direct research towards specific areas to combat these symptoms of the disease. Their proficiency in doing so is dependent on their training, which can be improved with CAPITAL. Once a TECHNOLOGY is researched, PHYSICIANS are able to implement these techniques to slow the progression of the disease and increase base resistance of a country. A PHYSICIANS effectiveness is dependent on available technology as well as their training, and can be improved with CAPITAL.
By default, EPIDEMIOLOGISTS can be considered the traditional RTS ‘SCOUT’ unit. They lead to discoveries based upon placement on the map. 
By default, PHYSICIANS can be considered the traditional RTS ‘ATTACK/DEFENSE’ units. They are able to slow the spread of disease based on the technologies available and their training.
By default, SCIENTISTS can be considered the traditional ‘RESEARCH’ trait in order to develop technologies. SCIENTISTS work towards developing a cure once unknown disease is discovered by EPIDEMIOLOGISTS. Depending on determined severity of disease, cure research will cost increased CAPITAL. For example, if only known SYMPTOM is ‘FEVER’, and low known population infected, SCIENTISTS can be instructed to either work towards cure or symptom, but it will cost more capital than if more severe symptoms and higher known population.
